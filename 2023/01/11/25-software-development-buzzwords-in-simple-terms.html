constantly running behind. Maybe even being embarrassed to ask. That’s exactly what this blog post is about - we will give you concrete examples of some frequently used terms, presented in an easy-to-understand manner.</p><p>So, without further ado, let&#x27;s get started with the examples.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="api">API<a href="#api" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to API" title="Direct link to API">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="API" src="/assets/images/img1-31b0a31097d31e4982e1d58754851325.png" width="1641" height="861" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Building applications on top of existing APIs</p><p>Stands for <strong>A</strong>pplication <strong>P</strong>rogramming <strong>I</strong>nterface. Interface being a point where two systems, subjects, organizations, etc. meet and interact. API in simple terms means any kind of utility that can be
consumed by other applications.</p><p>You may come up with an idea to build an alternative UI for managing GitHub Pull Requests to the one provided by github.com. To achieve that, you can integrate with the pull requests API from GitHub, and present the
data coming from this API.</p><p>Another example may be building a command line utility, where you want to find the biggest file on your computer, where you need to interact with the File-system API to get this information.</p><p>Most of modern Web applications are designed so, that a Front-end application (say ReactJS) is connected to a backend API, to get or update / delete some data.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="docker-containers">Docker containers<a href="#docker-containers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Docker containers" title="Direct link to Docker containers">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docker containers" src="/assets/images/img2-36b1387b09ba2c3ea3033c3265275e01.png" width="1953" height="917" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>A technology which can be installed on any modern Operating System with a purpose of packaging your entire applications for easier usability.</p><p>In order to package your application as a Docker container, you need to supply a file describing how to install all the dependencies that your application has, as well as the command that
needs to be executed to get you application up and running.</p><p>Once this file (most often named <code>Dockerfile</code>) is prepared, docker tool allows you to build an image of your application, which can be then pushed into many image registries out there
(i.e. <a href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://hub.docker.com/</a>, Amazon Container Registry, etc)</p><p>After the image has been pushed to a registry of your choice, anyone that has an access to the image repository can run your application.
Without containerization technology, you would have to worry about all the challenges when installing and running software on many operating systems.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="version-control--git">Version control / Git<a href="#version-control--git" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Version control / Git" title="Direct link to Version control / Git">​</a></h2><p>Version control refers to the ability to control the versions of the digital artifacts, whatever it may be (e-books, word docs, mp3 files...).</p><p>In the software development sense, we&#x27;re talking about the ability to manage versions of our software, as we change it.</p><p>Version control systems do not need to be exclusively used for code management: we can use it to version our images, word documents or any kind of digital artifact.</p><p>The advantage of versioning is the ability to track the progress of some software product, but also by versioning we have a chance to easily jump from version to version and that
may come handy in case we introduce a bug in version <code>1.4.2</code>, but luckily we know that a version <code>1.4.1</code> worked just fine.</p><p>Git is a cross-platform software which technically enables us to manage software changes, by creating new versions. Git is not the only technology that can be used for
versioning your software, but has become kind of industry standard, due to it’s flexibility, speed and it’s distributed model.</p><p>Git as the software is what behind the scene powers services, such as GitHub.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="open-source">Open-Source<a href="#open-source" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Open-Source" title="Direct link to Open-Source">​</a></h2><p>Every piece of software is based on some source-code that was written for it to be able to execute. There are 2 kinds of the source-code:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="closed-source">Closed-source<a href="#closed-source" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Closed-source" title="Direct link to Closed-source">​</a></h3><p>Examples of these would be Windows Operating System code-base, MacOS one, etc. Closed-source is mostly developed by the companies which do not want to publish their source-code,
because the code is their competitive advantage, and brings them financial income.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="open-source-1">Open-source<a href="#open-source-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Open-source" title="Direct link to Open-source">​</a></h3><p>The opposite side, which promotes values of public visibility of the code, so that everyone can access and view it. An additional step is an ability for everyone to change the code.
This lead to the enormous popularity of public tools, such as GitHub, which provide an easy way for people to collaborate on software projects as well as to share code from each other.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="merge--pull-requests">Merge / Pull requests<a href="#merge--pull-requests" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Merge / Pull requests" title="Direct link to Merge / Pull requests">​</a></h2><p>Pull requests is a formal process of contributing to the existing code-base. It helps ensuring that any code change that needs to be made, gets verified by experienced engineers.
The process looks something like this:</p><ul><li>There is an existing software code-base</li><li><strong>User A</strong> wants to extend existing functionality / fix existing bug</li><li>(S)he <strong>prepares a bugfix or a feature</strong> on own development machine</li><li>There is a <strong>User B</strong> who is considered a project maintainer (the one who knows the project well and ensures its quality)</li><li><strong>User A</strong> informs <strong>User B</strong> that (s)he wants the new feature/bugfix integrated integrated into existing code-base, which is a formal process (most often) performed using Web UIs provided
by the source-code hosting platform, e.g Github, Gitlab, BitBucket, etc, where the code is hosted.</li><li>The pull request then usually goes through a <strong>series of improvements</strong>, until it’s ready to be merged</li><li>After being merged, the new feature or bugfix is successfully integrated into the code-base</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="merge-conflicts">Merge conflicts<a href="#merge-conflicts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Merge conflicts" title="Direct link to Merge conflicts">​</a></h2><p>Working in a collaborative environment sometimes lead to a situation when two team members want to change the same line(s) of code, for different reasons. Let’s illustrate the problem</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Merge conflicts" src="/assets/images/img3-fccbc617caa1b04a7521e38479e71f93.png" width="1290" height="656" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Merge conflicts happen in the situation where there’s an existing code base (Nameprinter.kt in this example), and there are two developers, which <strong>want to update the same line(s) of code</strong>.
In the case from the image above we have a name variable defined, in the current file version, and we have two attempts to change it: the one to make it hold ”Merry” and the other one to hold ”Jack” value.</p><p>So, the two developers happily commit code in their local repositories,  and want to push their code to the main branch, which contains tested and stable code.
The first developer that wants to merge her changes into the main branch will have no issues with this at all. Let’s say that <code>val name = &quot;Merry&quot;</code> is what we now have in the main branch.
But, what happens when the second developer wants to push her change to the repo? Well, let’s say we’re using Git Version Control. With an attempt to push the change from the second developer, Git will report that the second developer is running slightly behind the server, and that the changes on the server need to be pulled locally, and then the second developer can push to code to the main branch.</p><p>At this moment the <strong>merge conflict</strong> will occur, giving a clear signal to the second developer that she <strong>needs to decide</strong> what should be the content of the problematic line. The second developer <strong>most often</strong>
needs to discuss with the person that contributed to the conflicting line, to find the adequate solution. Once there’s a solution agreed upon, the second developer can <strong>resolve the merge conflict</strong> and push her
changes to the central repository.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="synchronous--asynchronous-execution">Synchronous / asynchronous execution<a href="#synchronous--asynchronous-execution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Synchronous / asynchronous execution" title="Direct link to Synchronous / asynchronous execution">​</a></h2><p>Synchronous might be more easily understood if we use term blocking instead.

are synchronous, than user will have to wait 8 seconds in total until he gets a response from the server.</p><p>If you, instead, decide that only the first method, storeOrderInDb is synchronous, and other 2 aren&#x27;t, that means that user will have to wait only 2 seconds, until his order is successfully stored in the database,
and his order will eventually be sent to order management system and he will get a confirmation e-mail (this can wait a bit, and the user doesn&#x27;t need to get this done immediately).</p><p>A good rule of thumb would be that we should design for asynchronous, and the user should not be blocked unless there is a valid reason to do it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="software-versioning">Software versioning<a href="#software-versioning" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Software versioning" title="Direct link to Software versioning">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Software versioning" src="/assets/images/img4-ce454a7de5e62a4143116b0975e341b9.png" width="1500" height="1112" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Software evolves over time.</p><p>It gets bugs fixed and new features added, as well. It can be that, for whatever reason, some user wants to use the first version of our application, two years old, whereas some other user wants to use the latest one.
We need a way to store our updated software alongside its version somehow.</p><p>There are a couple of versioning schemas, <u><a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semantic versioning</a></u> being one of them with high adoption.</p><p>One additional reason to have versioning schema in place is an easier way to roll back some software that contains a bug for example, to a previous, known to work version. So, if we have rolled application version
<code>1.2.3</code>, and we want to roll it back, we could simply, from our software registry pull the version <code>1.2.2</code> and roll it out to the customers.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="logging">Logging<a href="#logging" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Logging" title="Direct link to Logging">​</a></h2><p>When developing our applications (mostly backend systems), it&#x27;s very important that during the application runtime execution we preserve some sort of messages containing important information about a system or user behavior.</p><p>An example would be that if a user enters 3 times wrong login credentials we store this message so that we can troubleshoot/diagnose given use-case. The recommended way of doing it would be writing these messages to the
standard out (console), which can later be searched through when needed.</p><p>Another case would be that in case our code talks to the database, and there&#x27;s a connectivity issue, we could store the message, something along the lines: &quot;There was a connection timeout connecting to the database x.y.z&quot;.</p><p>Often, these logging libraries contain various logging levels, such as <code>DEBUG</code>, <code>INFO</code>, <code>FATAL</code> which help us set the importance of the things we are logging: we can then, for instance, filter logs which are considered
<code>FATAL</code> and then do the analysis and the troubleshooting.</p><p>Often you want to enable <code>DEBUG</code> level logging on your dev environment, so that you can additionally assert if everything runs as expected, and use <code>WARN</code>/<code>FATAL</code> level on your production, to avoid noise, and see only
issues in the runtime.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="json">JSON<a href="#json" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to JSON" title="Direct link to JSON">​</a></h2><p>JSON is a human-readable and a portable data serialization format . It&#x27;s famous for being used for a data interchange between browsers and servers, but not exclusive to that.</p><p>An example of JSON serialized (formatted) data would be:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="JSON" src="/assets/images/img5-970374c5daca50ca548e071b46551d9a.png" width="1500" height="1088" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>JSON provides a couple of data types, such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, and all of them together are enough to express any sort of data, which is one of the reasons
why it&#x27;s heavily used (apart from human readability).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="request--response">Request / Response<a href="#request--response" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Request / Response" title="Direct link to Request / Response">​</a></h2><p>Very popular interaction model between two (software) parties, where one side (client) initiates the communication by sending <strong>a request</strong> to the other party (server) which upon
understanding and processing the request sends <strong>a response</strong> back to the client. Very often you’ll hear HTTP Request / HTTP Response which is a specialized case where such
communication going over the network, using HTTP protocol.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="scalability">Scalability<a href="#scalability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Scalability" title="Direct link to Scalability">​</a></h2><p>A frequently used term is software scalability, which is an ability of the software to cope with the ever-increasing load, often as consequence of an increased number of users using
the software at the same time. Applications should be designed in such a way to be able to handle the increased load in a reasonable manner, by responding to the user in as short
amount of time as possible, or, when not possible, informing the user that the system is experiencing high load, and that the requests can’t be fulfilled.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="abstraction">Abstraction<a href="#abstraction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Abstraction" title="Direct link to Abstraction">​</a></h2><p>You will very frequently come across this term, as you progress in your career.

Often, these databases ensure that the data persisted is also backed up, to ensure there&#x27;s no data loss.</p><p>Apart from the ability to store the data, the databases provide a way to query the data and access it.</p><p>Two very popular types of databases nowadays are relational and document databases.

The communication goes like:</p><p>HTTP client application (say, your browser) sends a HTTP Request to a remote HTTP server</p><p>HTTP Server receives the request, and responds with a HTTP response, which then client handles in some way.</p><p>An example of the HTTP communication would be the one between a browser and a server needed to fetch resources for rendering web page: html documents, css styles, JavaScrtipt scripts, Ajax requests, etc.</p><p>HTTP contains a server host name, request and response headers, depending on use-case request and / or response body, cookies etc.</p><p>HTTP supports the concept of verbs, such as <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>DELETE</code> which provides a way to express more clearly what do try to do with the remote resource, like getting some resource, deleting it, and so on.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rest-api">Rest API<a href="#rest-api" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Rest API" title="Direct link to Rest API">​</a></h2><p>Rest API is layer sitting on top of aforementioned HTTP protocol, and is based on the concept of resources.</p><p>Rest API, like any other API, is used to build applications by integrating with them.

One resource can be (let&#x27;s use Github API as an example) a repository, and Github API states that we can manage particular repository via their APIs, by accessing particular URLs and sending correct input data using proper HTTP verbs.</p><p>Apart from Rest APIs, there are also emerging GraphQL APIs, which are also sitting on top of HTTP protocols but differ in philosophy of how the data should be accessed and managed.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ide">IDE<a href="#ide" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to IDE" title="Direct link to IDE">​</a></h2><p>Stands for Integrated Development Environment, which is a piece of software used to develop applications.
