import MyImg from '@site/src/components/MyImg';

Our server has root access with a password.

`ssh root@x.x.x.x`

It‚Äôs default, it‚Äôs how it‚Äôs been provisioned.

It‚Äôs not good.

## Fortifying The Remote Access
### First of all, the root user is a dangerous user.
Anyone accessing our VPS with root user has unrestricted access, can create or delete anything on the filesystem, start or stop any service. With not necessarily bad intentions, you could break stuff accidentally.

Root user is so obvious bots are attacking constantly (we had around 1752 access attempts in 12h from starting the server).

### Secondly, password access is a vulnerability.
Scripts can rapidly re-try various passwords until they find it. Passwords can be guessed if you are not using random characters. Passwords can be sniffed with keyloggers.

### Thirdly, the port itself is a danger.

Although there are over 120k ports in your server, only three of them account for 65% of all attacks. [And one of them is port 22, the ssh port](https://www.alertlogic.com/blog/65-of-port-vulnerabilities-target-just-three-ports/).

That‚Äôs a lot of topics, so I‚Äôll break it down into multiple posts.

## How To Turn My SSH Access Into a Fortress?

Let‚Äôs say you have secret documents from ESA, NASA and Pentagon. You have to protect it from Russian hackers.

So you go to contabo.com and buy a VPS for 4,50‚Ç¨. After 5 minutes it‚Äôs up and ready. You SSH inside with your root access and place the secret file there.

`esa_nasa_pentagon_db_dump.sql`

### Close The Doors

For all the reasons mentioned above, you need to close the doors. We are using ansible (https://docs.ansible.com/) to provision our servers.

We have a playbook called close_the_doors.yaml and it looks like this:

```yaml
- hosts: all
 become: true

 vars:
   users:
     - name: gg
       email: gg@gransoftware.de
       public_key: "
     ,,__     oink
    c''   )?     oink
      ''''
          "
     - name: do
       email: do@gransoftware.de
       public_key: "wink wink :)"

 tasks:
   - name: Create users
     ansible.builtin.user:
       name: "{{ item.name }}"
       comment: "{{ item.email }}"
       group: sudo
       append: true
     loop: "{{ users }}"

   - name: Ensure .ssh directory exists
     ansible.builtin.file:
       path: "/home/{{ item.name }}/.ssh"
       state: directory
       mode: '0700'
       owner: "{{ item.name }}"
     loop: "{{ users }}"

   - name: Copy public keys
     ansible.builtin.copy:
       content: "{{ item.public_key }}"
       dest: "/home/{{ item.name }}/.ssh/authorized_keys"
       mode: '0600'
       owner: "{{ item.name }}"
     loop: "{{ users }}"

   - name: Disable root login
     ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
       path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
       regexp: '^PermitRootLogin'
       line: 'PermitRootLogin no'

   - name: Allow no password for sudo group in sudoers
     ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
       path: /etc/sudoers
       line: '%sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL'
       validate: 'visudo -cf %s'

   - name: Disable PasswordAuthentication
     lineinfile:
       path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
       regexp: '^PasswordAuthentication'
       line: 'PasswordAuthentication no'

    - name: Enable PubkeyAuthentication
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        regexp: '^#PubkeyAuthentication'
        line: 'PubkeyAuthentication yes'

   - name: Change default SSH port
     ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
       path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
       regexp: '^#?Port'
       line: 'Port 2222'
     notify: Restart sshd

 handlers:
   - name: Restart sshd
     ansible.builtin.service:
       name: sshd
       state: restarted
```
### Disable root Access
To close the doors we need to disallow root login.

Most likely, the default sshd settings of your server (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) look like this:
```
...
#LoginGraceTime 2m
PermitRootLogin yes # <--- this line allows to use ssh root@0.0.0.0
#StrictModes yes
#MaxAuthTries 6
#MaxSessions 10
...
```

Ansible has this [lineinfile module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/lineinfile_module.html) that allows us to:
- make sure that a defined line exists in a file,
- or find lines with regex and replace them with the defined line.

```yaml
   - name: Disable root login
     ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
       path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
       regexp: '^PermitRootLogin'
       line: 'PermitRootLogin no'
```

Once it's done, no amount of `ssh root@x.x.x.x` will let them bots in.

### Disable Password Authentication

Then we disable passwords for all users, forcing them to use keys. The default sshd_config may look like this:
```
...
#PubkeyAuthentication yes
...
PasswordAuthentication yes
...
```
In order to make the remote access to VPS more secure, we'll disable password authentication and force users to use keys.
```yaml
- name: Disable PasswordAuthentication
     lineinfile:
       path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
       regexp: '^PasswordAuthentication'
       line: 'PasswordAuthentication no'

- name: Enable PubkeyAuthentication
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        regexp: '^#PubkeyAuthentication'
        line: 'PubkeyAuthentication yes'

```

From now on, no one can SSH into the [VPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server) using root user or passwords.

All changes in the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file require restart of the SSH Daemon. More about this in a bit.

### Create Custom Users
Effectively, you would lose access to your `esa_nasa_pentagon_db_dump` file. To maintain access to the VPS, we‚Äôll create users in the same playbook.

Use vars to create a list of users that you want to give access to. Those are defined by a name, email and a public key. I won‚Äôt explain [how to generate keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

```yaml
vars:
  users:
    - name: John Doe
      email: jd@gransoftware.de
      public_key: "RSA or whatever you use"
    - name: Jane Doe
      email: jd2@gransoftware.de
      public_key: "RSA or whatever you use"
```
Storing public keys in git is fine, so we‚Äôll simply hardcode them. And by using another handy [module from Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/user_module.html) we can easily create users on the machine (you don‚Äôt have to loop if you need only one user).

It‚Äôs important to add them to the sudo group so they can operate the VPS. If your users are in multiple groups, then set the [flag ‚Äúappend‚Äù to true](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/user_module.html#parameter-append).

Now that users are created, it doesn't mean yet that they can login via SSH. To allow this, we have to create the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` files for each user. Sooo, another [module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/file_module.html) and another loop.

```yaml
- name: Ensure .ssh directory exists
  ansible.builtin.file:
    path: "/home/{{ item.name }}/.ssh"
    state: directory
    mode: '0700'
    owner: "{{ item.name }}"
  loop: "{{ users }}"

- name: Copy public keys
  ansible.builtin.copy:
    content: "{{ item.public_key }}"
    dest: "/home/{{ item.name }}/.ssh/authorized_keys"
    mode: '0600'
    owner: "{{ item.name }}"
  loop: "{{ users }}"
```
Important! [Make sure that the directory has a mode 700 and that the user owns the directory](https://askubuntu.com/a/746246).

Once the directory is created, you use the []copy module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/copy_module.html) to create a file (confusing name, aint it?) with the public key.

### Change Default SSH Port
The best way to win a fight is to avoid it. And since the majority of bots and scripts attack port 22, we‚Äôll simply change it and mitigate the huge swaths of potential attacks by doing so.

```yaml
   - name: Change default SSH port
     ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
       path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
       regexp: '^#?Port'
       line: 'Port 2222'
     notify: Restart sshd # <-- this will trigger a handler. See below üëá
```
I know, the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file got really pulverized. But it‚Äôs necessary to fortify remote access to the VPS.

:::tip
For the changes in this file to take effect, you need to restart the sshd. Ansible lets you do that by defining a `handler` and by using `notify` to trigger it by name after the task is done.
```yaml
handlers:
  - name: Restart sshd
    ansible.builtin.service:
      name: sshd
      state: restarted
```
:::

Now fire it up
`ansible-playbook close_the_doors.yaml`

And sleep well, knowing that the KGB won‚Äôt steal your Western secrets.
