POC and MVP are two phrases that are widely used in the context of digital transformation a product development. What exactly do they mean? In the sentences that follow, we'll talk about it briefly.

## What is POC?

To start off. Both are done at the early stages of software development (or product development in general). But they have very different goals.

POC (Proof-of-Concept) will prove (duh!) if the idea is technically feasible and useful enough. MVP (Minimum Viable Product) will minimise time and effort and let you see if there is a place in the market for your idea.

A POC is a prototype or a minimal viable version of a product or service that is used to test and confirm whether an idea or concept is feasible. It serves primarily as an example of **how the concept is possible** and can be effectively implemented. A POC is often constructed with the very minimum set of features and functionalities necessary **to demonstrate the viability of the concept**.

## What is MVP?

An MVP, on the other hand, is a product or service that provides the bare minimum of features and **functionalities required to satisfy early clients and collect feedback for further development**. An MVP, as opposed to a POC, is the final product or service that has been provided to a small number of clients for testing and feedback. With the intention of learning from client input and using that learning to iterate and improve the product, the MVP is created to be a minimum viable version of the product that **can be built and launched rapidly**.

## So what is the difference between POC and MVP?

In conclusion, a POC is used to determine whether an **idea is possible**, and an MVP is a **completed product** or service that has the bare minimum of features necessary to be offered to clients. MVP is considered a step further than POC. As an example, your initial proof-of-concept for a lemon stand may be a simple setup consisting of a plastic table with a manual juicer placed in front of your garage. However, the minimum viable product (MVP) would be a fully operational, legally registered business that complies with hygiene regulations, operating out of a rented commercial space and using an electric juicer.

## What is an example of a POC?

Imagine you discover an opportunity. You have connections with farmers who raise crickets, grasshoppers and mealworms. One day, you read about the growing popularity of edible insects in your city. You even meet someone who expresses interest in trying them but can't find a reliable source. This is an opportunity to build a business by connecting the dots between these two needs.

The first step would not be to create an online store with complex features like user registration, pictures of insects, ratings, vouchers, and loyalty programs. Instead, you would start by creating a simple spreadsheet to keep track of your insect farmers in one column, their stock in another column, and possibly prices in a third column. This would serve as your database. Then, you would open a new spreadsheet to store information about your clients, orders, and transactions. This would serve as your proof-of-concept.

If this process proves successful, and you are able to match customers with farmers, you have the beginnings of a business. The next step would be to create a minimum viable product (MVP).

## What is an example of an MVP?

Based on the results of your proof-of-concept, you now understand the minimum set of features required to meet the needs of your early customers.

Your customers currently need to inquire about what is available before they place an order. Therefore, the MVP would be a website that displays up-to-date information about the insects currently available and a button to place orders.

At this stage, it is not necessary to implement a user database, secure management panel or a fraud detection system. Before expanding the feature set of your MVP, it is important to determine if each feature is a necessary addition or just a desirable one.

After launching your MVP, you can gather feedback from customers and add additional features that enhance its appeal. For example, if users request the ability to view their order history, you can add a login feature that allows them to save their orders. If customers ask for a wishlist, you can add a wishlist feature.

## Conclusion

A proof-of-concept is a basic and not a long-term way to evaluate the feasibility of an idea. If it proves viable, you can then create a minimum viable product (MVP) to meet the needs of your customers. From there, you can gradually build and improve upon your MVP to create a full-fledged product. That's why it's important to make sure your MVP is scalable and sustainable from the start. This can be challenging, and it is often beneficial to seek the advice of experts.
