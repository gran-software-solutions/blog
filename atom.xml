management API.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-the-problem-to-solve">What's the problem to solve?<a href="#whats-the-problem-to-solve" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's the problem to solve?" title="Direct link to What's the problem to solve?">​</a></h2><p>The issue we want to tackle is known as <strong>"lost updates"</strong>. When do such updates happen? When the same resources are attempted to be updated by multiple clients at the same time.
What happens in such cases, if you don't have any special handling? <strong>The last update wins</strong>.</p><p>Let's illustrate this with an example of two different users trying to update the same Wiki article:</p><br><br><p>The issue with this flow is that the User2 was able to update the document, without even caring if the document might have
changed in the meantime. User1's update <strong>was lost</strong>.</p><p>The solution is to make one of the two users (User2 in this case) angry 🙂.</p><p>How's that? Let's read on.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="optimistic-locking---the-solution-to-lost-updates">Optimistic locking - the solution to "lost updates"<a href="#optimistic-locking---the-solution-to-lost-updates" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Optimistic locking - the solution to &quot;lost updates&quot;" title="Direct link to Optimistic locking - the solution to &quot;lost updates&quot;">​</a></h2><p>You may have noticed that some software you used in the past had a mechanism to prevent "lost updates". Let's take a Wiki as an example.
As a Wiki page is shared among your teammates, and as writing a Wiki page is a collaborative effort, and additionally takes a while to write,
the chances are that someone else may have updated the page as of the time you were writing your changes.</p><p>Usually such tools will let you know that you need to sync your changes with the latest version of the page. This may lead to conflicts that
you need to resolve, before saving your work.</p><p>You may have expereinced the same by using Git Source Code Versioning tool. If you try to push your changes to a remote repository, and someone
else pushed their changes to the same branch as you, you will get an error message saying that you need to pull the remote changes first.</p><p>The beauty of this design is that it forces you to base your work on the work of others, <strong>whether you like it or not</strong>.</p><p>The design implemented in both cases is called <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"optimistic locking"</a></u>.
Simply put, it's an assumption that the transactions will not interfere often, and that there is no need to lock the resources they may change. Instead,
transactions are allowed to change the data, but before they are committed, there is a check to see if the data has been changed in the meantime. Non
locking approach brings a performance benefit.</p><p>Later in this article, we will show an example of the Wiki page management API, and we will use optimistic locking to prevent "lost updates".</p><p>Technical means we will use to implement optimistic locking are <code>ETag</code> and <code>If-Match</code> HTTP headers.</p><p>Let's learn first about ETags first.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-etags">What are ETags?<a href="#what-are-etags" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are ETags?" title="Direct link to What are ETags?">​</a></h2><p><code>ETag</code> (stands for <strong>E</strong>ntity Tag) is an <u><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag#avoiding_mid-air_collisions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTTP response header</a></u>. The value of
this header is an opaque identifier assigned by servers to specific versions of resources. If the content of the resource changes, the ETag changes as well.
ETag is used for caching purposes, as well as for concurrency control. An example of an <code>ETag</code> header:</p><div class="language-http codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#bfc7d5;--prism-background-color:#292d3e"><div

Strong <code>ETag</code>s imply byte-by-byte equality. Weak <code>ETag</code>s imply semantic equality.</p><p>Technically, weak <code>ETag</code>s are prefixed with <code>W/</code>. Strong <code>ETag</code>s are not prefixed.</p><p>An example of a weak <code>ETag</code> would be <code>W/"bakck3"</code>, whereas an example of a strong <code>ETag</code> would be <code>"bfc13a64729c4290ef5b2c2730249c88ca92d82d"</code>.</p><p>Strong <code>ETag</code>s are usually preferred, as they are more reliable.

<code>If-Match</code> contains list of <code>ETag</code>s. The flow works like this:</p><ol><li>A user requests a resource from the server, and the server responds with the resource and its <code>ETag</code>.</li><li>User makes local modification to the resource</li><li>User sends the modified resource to the server, along with the <code>ETag</code> of the resource it received from the server. This <code>ETag</code> is sent in
<code>If-Match</code> header.</li><li>Server checks if the <code>ETag</code> in <code>If-Match</code> header matches the <code>ETag</code> of the resource on the server. If they match, the server proceeds with
handling the request.</li><li>If the <code>ETag</code>s don't match, the server responds with <code>412 Precondition Failed</code> response.</li></ol><p>Let's illustrate this with an example based on our Wiki page management API:</p><br><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="real-world-example">Real-world example<a href="#real-world-example" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Real-world example" title="Direct link to Real-world example">​</a></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, we designed the Wiki page management API.

as well as to update an existing one.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="a turtle sleeping on a beach" src="/blog/assets/images/img-e65d5f5bf967aa41439c8ee66d9c1bfd.jpg" width="640" height="353" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Is there a deliberate understanding of what a “technical debt” is and what it isn’t? In this article we will see how the understanding of technical debt evolved and what it means today to organisations and teams
working with software-intensive projects.</p><blockquote><p><em>“Slow and steady wins the race.”</em></p><p>— Aesop, ancient storyteller, 600 BCE</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-original-metaphor">The Original Metaphor<a href="#the-original-metaphor" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Original Metaphor" title="Direct link to The Original Metaphor">​</a></h2><p>The term was coined in early 1990 by Ward Cunningham<sup id="fnref-1-166d63"><a href="#fn-1-166d63" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>. He first used this term as a financial metaphor for software development. At that time he was working on a financial product and, inspired by George Lakoff<sup id="fnref-2-166d63"><a href="#fn-2-166d63" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup>,
wanted to reach a common understanding with stakeholders. As he said:</p><blockquote><p><em>“I coined the debt metaphor to explain the refactoring that we were doing in the Y Cash product”</em></p></blockquote><p>What is worth noting here is that Cunningham’s metaphor is strictly related to refactoring of code. The reason why would you need to refactor your software, Cunningham explains using following words:</p><blockquote><p><em>“I thought that rushing software out the door, to get some experience with it, was a good idea. But of course, you would eventually go back and as you learn things about that software you would repay that loan by
refactoring the program to reflect your experience as you acquired it”</em></p></blockquote><p>The gist of it is that while software is developed with a high uncertainty, you learn as you go and incorporate those learnings into your software by refactoring. Cunningham explains also the consequences of not doing it:</p><blockquote><p><em>“If you develop a program for a long period of time by only adding features and never reorganising it to reflect your understanding of those features then eventually this program does not contain any understanding
and all efforts to work on it take longer and longer, and you will make zero progress”</em></p></blockquote><p>In short: not refactoring your code grinds your project to a halt.</p><p>Cunningham’s metaphor tells us that:</p><ol><li>You can create software that you understand only partially - <strong>this is your loan</strong>.</li><li>Working on a code that does not reflect your current understanding of your problem costs extra time - <strong>this is your interest</strong>.</li><li>As you learn more about your problems, you ought to refactor your code - <strong>repay your loan</strong>.</li><li>Otherwise, you make no progress - <strong>or your purchasing power goes to zero</strong>.</li></ol><p>Originally, the metaphor is about understanding the software you are working on. Some extended its meaning to include quality issues - hacks and workarounds. But Cunningham was very clear about this:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Bloggers have explained the debt metaphor and confused it with the idea that you could write code poorly with the intention of doing a good job later and thinking that was the primary source of debt. I'm never in favour
of writing code poorly, but I am in favour of writing code to reflect your current understanding of the problem even if that understanding is partial.”</em></p></blockquote><p>In other words, <strong>technical debt is not an excuse to produce low quality code</strong>. Technical debt is about producing good quality code without full understanding of the problem. Low quality code can prevent you from paying back
your debt as Cunningham explains:</p><blockquote><p><em>“The ability to pay back debt and make the debt metaphor work for your advantage depends upon you <strong>writing code that is clean enough to be able to refactor it</strong> as you come to understand your problem”</em></p></blockquote><p>The original financial metaphor tells us what technical debt is and what it is not:</p><p>Technical debt is not:</p><ul><li>Bugs</li><li>Convoluted code</li><li>Unreadable code</li><li>Magic numbers</li><li>Hacks</li><li>Duck tape methods</li></ul><p>Technical debt is:</p><ul><li>Solution that seems to be optimal today but may not be optimal tomorrow</li><li>Solution that we hope to be optimal, although we have no possibility to assess it today</li></ul><p>If you haven’t yet, you should watch his <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pqeJFYwnkjE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a></u></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="uncle-bobs-take-on-technical-debt">Uncle Bob’s Take On Technical Debt<a href="#uncle-bobs-take-on-technical-debt" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Uncle Bob’s Take On Technical Debt" title="Direct link to Uncle Bob’s Take On Technical Debt">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="mess" src="/blog/assets/images/img1-dc8f9776266c29576e32c8fb5471e346.jpg" width="640" height="480" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>You probably have no clue who I am, but you surely know Uncle Bob. He agreed with Cunningham that technical debt does not come from low quality code:</p><blockquote><p><em>“A mess is not a technical debt. A mess is just a mess.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Uncle Bob draws a thick line between low quality and a technical debt. He says that a technical debt is a rational but risky decision that can potentially be beneficial in the future:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Technical debt decisions are made based on real project constraints. They are risky, but they can be beneficial. The decision to make a mess is never rational, is always based on laziness and unprofessionalism, and has no chance
of paying off in the future. A mess is always a loss.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Mess on the other hand is always a loss. Uncle Bob cannot find an excuse for “quick and dirty” solutions, hacks and workarounds that sometimes are labelled a technical debt. On the contrary. Uncle Bob believes that the more debt you
take on, the more discipline you must exercise in your project:</p><blockquote><p><em>“When you buy a house and take on a big mortgage debt, you tighten up all your spending and accounting. You clean up your books and your budgets. You behave with increased discipline. The same is true of technical debt.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Uncle Bob pretty much reiterates Cunningham’s point of view about what technical debt isn’t:</p><ul><li>Bugs</li><li>Convoluted code</li><li>Unreadable code</li><li>Magic numbers</li><li>Hacks</li><li>Duck tape methods</li></ul><p>And what technical debt is:</p><ul><li>Solution that seems to be optimal today but may not be optimal tomorrow</li><li>Solution that we hope to be optimal, although we have no possibility to assess it today</li></ul><p>As an example, Uncle Bob is using a decision about iframes vs AJAX. On a higher level it could be a scenario where a product team does not take into account internationalisation in their designs but at some point in time the company
introduces their product on a different continent and so an expensive redesign is required.</p><p>Read more on <u><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/a-mess-is-not-a-technical-debt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uncle Bob’s blog</a></u>.</p><h1>Martin Fowler’s Take On Technical Debt</h1><p><img loading="lazy" alt="mess" src="/blog/assets/images/img2-7738737635706836192116d5ae761ec4.png" width="619" height="598" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Martin Fowler is an equally important persona in software engineering that expressed his view on what technical debt is and isn’t. In contrast to Ward Cunningham and Uncle Bob, Martin Fowler found a place for low quality code, and
even ignorance, in technical debt. As he said:</p><blockquote><p><em>“The metaphor of debt is sometimes used to justify neglecting internal quality. The argument is that it takes time and effort to stop cruft from building up.”</em></p></blockquote><p>We will discuss shortly what is meant by “cruft”.</p><p>Fowler says that technical debt is both deliberate or inadvertent and reckless or prudent. This creates a taxonomy of technical debt:</p><ul><li>Inadvertent Reckless</li><li>Deliberate Reckless</li><li>Deliberate Prudent</li><li>Inadvertent Prudent</li></ul><p>With those 4 types of technical debt, the whole field is covered. Meaning, a technical debt can originate from low quality code (reckless) or assumption based decisions (prudent). To draw a more detailed picture, we could describe those
types like so:</p><p><strong>Inadvertent Reckless</strong> - We don’t know how to do it, but we will anyway<br>
<strong>Deliberate Reckless</strong> - We know how to do it but doing it quick and dirty will maybe save us time<br>
<strong>Deliberate Prudent</strong> - We know it’s not good, but this is a one time job and so worth it<br>
<strong>Inadvertent Prudent</strong> - Now we see the difference between our assumptions and real requirements<br></p><p>Fowler says that debt, in the form of deficiencies in internal quality, will build up and make it harder to modify the system. Those deficiencies are cruft that lives next to essential complexity required to do the job.</p><p>Neglecting internal quality may be a good call if managed properly, e.g. to roll out features faster and repay the debt as soon as possible. Unfortunately, more often than not it is mismanaged and, as Fowler puts it:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Cruft has a quick impact, slowing down the very new features that are needed quickly.”</em></p></blockquote><p>You can read more about his point of view <u><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></u> and <u><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></u>.</p><h1>My Take On Technical Debt</h1><p>The metaphor of technical debt is attracting academic attention. Since 2006, a number of research in this area is growing systematically as you can see in the following table <sup id="fnref-3-166d63"><a href="#fn-3-166d63" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup>:</p><table><thead><tr><th>2006</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>total*</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>17</td><td>24</td><td>58</td><td>47</td><td>61</td><td>208</td></tr></tbody></table><p>*as of 2016</p><p>After studying a big portion of those papers, the answer is as usual: it depends.</p><p>The term itself has no universal definition and its meaning is fluid. From a company to a company, from an individual to an individual. It changes scope, taxonomy and importance. It touches every aspect of software development. From
design and architecture, through infrastructure, tests and bugs up to requirements, processes and even people.</p><p>The only thing that matters, though, is <strong>what technical debt means to your team</strong> and organisation. It is of utmost importance to have a deliberate understanding of technical debt within the boundaries of your context - be it a team
or the whole company.
However, you define technical debt, there are a few rules of thumb that every team and organisation should follow:</p><p>You must be able to reason about technical debt with developers <strong>and</strong> managers.<br>
Technical debt must be <strong>discussed openly and transparently</strong>.<br>
Technical debt must be <strong>documented</strong> along with cost of its existence and cost of potential payoff.<br></p><p>Increasing visibility of technical debt is the first step of managing it. Just because you don’t manage technical debt, doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It’s always there, incurring costs, causing delays, bugs, incidents and users’
dissatisfaction.</p><h1>What You Can Do Today To Manage Technical Debt</h1><p>Ask your fellow teammates how they <strong>define technical debt</strong>. Collect all definitions, put them on a wall, do a brainstorming session. Ask questions about anything that slows you down:</p><ul><li>Are bugs technical debt?</li><li>Are code smells technical debt?</li><li>Are missing requirements technical debt?</li></ul><p>Once you know what to call a technical debt, create a label in your issue tracker or project management system and <strong>start writing tickets for technical debt</strong> and labelling them. Put them in the backlog!</p><blockquote><p><em>“All work is work; all work goes on the backlog.”</em> <sup id="fnref-4-166d63"><a href="#fn-4-166d63" class="footnote-ref">4</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>A good technical debt ticket includes information about:<br>
<strong>Where is it</strong> - it could be a file, module, piece of architecture or even part of your deployment process<br>
<strong>Cost of its existence</strong> - what problems does it incur. You cannot really estimate the value of it, but at least try using fibonacci numbers or t-shirt sizes.<br>
<strong>Cost of repayment</strong> - how much effort would it take to fix it. Again, try abstracting it away. Maybe the same way you do with your tickets (unless you estimate hours, then stop doing it)<br></p><p>Having a proper ticket helps to reason about when and if to repay a specific debt. And having it in the backlog allows you to <strong>prioritise technical debt</strong>. Every time you decide which tickets to deal with, ask if there are technical
debt tickets related to the specific area of the code you want to work on. E.g. if you are adding a new endpoint to your REST API, ask if there are technical debt issues with the router or input validation. And if so, do them first.</p><p>Below you will find an example of a technical debt ticket:</p><table><thead><tr><th>[TD]<!-- --> Extending router is cumbersome and difficult to test</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Where is it</strong>: there are a bunch of files you have to touch when adding a new endpoint. First the router, then you need to extend interfaces and every class that’s implementing it. There’s no proper test for the router, only unit tests for implementations.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cost of its existence</strong>: I’d say it’s an 8. We are at the stage where a new endpoint is coming up pretty much every sprint, so we constantly add to the complexity. If we don’t fix it soon, it will grow to a 13.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cost of repayment</strong>: To fix it, we need to reduce the number of interfaces and maybe replace some with a functional approach (lambdas?). With concept and implementation I think it’s a day or two. Or 5 points if you will.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Yes, I believe estimating time should be avoided. But I am not going to force it on anyone.</p><p>And whatever you do, <strong>follow established software engineering practices</strong>. Otherwise, you will accrue reckless and inadvertent technical debt.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn-1-166d63"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham</a><a href="#fnref-1-166d63" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></li><li id="fn-2-166d63"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphors_We_Live_By" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphors_We_Live_By</a><a href="#fnref-2-166d63" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></li><li id="fn-3-166d63">Nicolli S.R.

Unit tests, unlike some other tests, need to be able to execute very quickly, providing you with an almost instant answer to the question, "Does my code work as expected?” On top of that, they should be isolated from any external processes, like file-system access or calling databases or web services, during their execution.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="anatomy-of-unit-tests">Anatomy of Unit tests<a href="#anatomy-of-unit-tests" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Anatomy of Unit tests" title="Direct link to Anatomy of Unit tests">​</a></h2><p>In general, we should plan our test method implementation to be divided into three parts, as shown below:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Example banner" src="/blog/assets/images/img1-b79374be116362be8aee402f2657b2df.png" width="1949" height="750" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Let’s now explain each of these three phases.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="arrange-phase">Arrange phase<a href="#arrange-phase" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Arrange phase" title="Direct link to Arrange phase">​</a></h2><p>In this phase we "emulate" execution environment of the code under test.

This project involved implementing new technologies and processes to streamline operations and improve overall efficiency.</p><p>The results were impressive, with significant cost savings and increased productivity. By sharing own experience and knowledge in this blog post, you can gain valuable insights on how to apply similar strategies in your own industries and achieve similar success in you own digital transformation initiatives.</p><p>Whether you're in automotive or any other field, the principles and approach can be adapted to fit your particular case.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-were-the-challenges-we-were-facing">What were the challenges we were facing?<a href="#what-were-the-challenges-we-were-facing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What were the challenges we were facing?" title="Direct link to What were the challenges we were facing?">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Challenges" src="/blog/assets/images/img1-5ac26411d5d4c8c879d959118785acc5.png" width="960" height="640" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>There was an initial understanding of what had to be done.</p><p>It's common for businesses to have a general idea of the software product they want to develop, but not all the details worked out yet. This is completely normal and expected. In fact, it's often better to start with a "half-baked" idea and let it evolve and take shape during the development process.</p><p>The development process can act as a discovery phase where the idea is shaped, features are added or removed, and the final product is refined to meet the specific needs of the business and its customers. This allows for a more flexible approach and the ability to adapt to changing market conditions or customer feedback. It's important to remember that the software development process is iterative, and the idea will likely evolve and change over time. Businesses should be open to this process and be prepared to adjust their original vision as needed. This approach ultimately leads to a more polished and successful end product.</p><p>Approximately in June 2021, when there was only a broad knowledge of what needed to be done, I joined the project. The project began with the following team in place: I had a senior backend engineer role, another senior devops consultant was already on the team when I joined, and representing the client was a product owner.</p><p>Let's delve deeper into the challenges we faced once the project began.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="integration-with-an-inexperienced-internal-engineering-team">Integration with an inexperienced internal engineering team<a href="#integration-with-an-inexperienced-internal-engineering-team" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Integration with an inexperienced internal engineering team" title="Direct link to Integration with an inexperienced internal engineering team">​</a></h2><p>Collaborating with an engineering team that lacked experience building modern software systems presented a number of difficulties. One major issue was that the team was unfamiliar with the latest development methodologies, tools, and technologies. This lead to delays and inefficiencies in the development process, as well as a lack of scalability and maintainability in the final product.</p><p>Another challenge was that the team lacked the necessary skills to design and implement complex systems. This can result in poor system architecture, which leads to issues with performance, security, and reliability. Additionally, the team didn’t have any experience troubleshooting and debugging problems that arise during development, which can further slow down the process.</p><p>To mitigate these difficulties, it was necessary to provide additional training and support to the team (often in the form of pair programming, collaborative coding sessions, etc.), as well as to establish clear communication and collaboration processes.

It involves planning, organizing, and overseeing the development process to ensure that the project is completed on time, within budget, and to the satisfaction of the stakeholders. Without proper project management methodologies and tools, software development projects can suffer from a variety of negative impacts.</p><p>What are the risks of not having any project management strategy when joining a project?</p><p>One of the most significant negative impacts of not having project management methodologies and tools is <strong>poor communication</strong>. Without these tools, it can be difficult to keep track of project progress, assign tasks, and communicate with team members. This can lead to <strong>delays, misunderstandings, and confusion</strong>.</p><p>Another negative impact is the <strong>lack of organization</strong>. Without project management methodologies and tools, it can be difficult to <strong>keep track of project timelines, budgets, and resources</strong>. This can lead to <strong>delays, cost overruns, and a lack of accountability</strong>.</p><p>In addition, without project management methodologies and tools, it can be difficult <strong>to identify and manage risks</strong>. This can lead to unexpected issues and delays, and can also lead to higher costs.</p><p>Finally, without project management methodologies and tools, it can be difficult to ensure that the project is meeting the needs of the stakeholders. This can lead to <strong>dissatisfaction</strong> and, ultimately, <strong>the failure of the project</strong>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="no-consensus-about-the-way-of-working-and-common-core-values">No consensus about the way of working and common core values<a href="#no-consensus-about-the-way-of-working-and-common-core-values" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to No consensus about the way of working and common core values" title="Direct link to No consensus about the way of working and common core values">​</a></h2><p>When a team is working on a software development project, it's important for everyone to be on the same page about how the work will be done and what values are important to the team. Without consensus, things can quickly become chaotic and inefficient.</p><p>One of the biggest problems with not having a consensus is that team members may have different ideas about how the work should be done. This can lead to confusion and delays as team members try to figure out what they are supposed to be doing. It can also lead to frustration as team members feel that their ideas are not being heard or respected.</p><p>Another problem with not having a consensus is that team members may have different ideas about what is important in the project. This can lead to unmet expectations as team members may feel that their priorities are not being considered. It can also lead to disappointment, as team members may feel that the project is not meeting their expectations.</p><p>Finally, not having a consensus can lead to decreased satisfaction among team members. When team members feel that their ideas and values are not being respected, they may become disengaged and demotivated. This can lead to a lack of commitment to the project and a decrease in overall team performance.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cumbersome-tooling-available">Cumbersome tooling available<a href="#cumbersome-tooling-available" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cumbersome tooling available" title="Direct link to Cumbersome tooling available">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Bad tooling" src="/blog/assets/images/img3-4b01183524d6f5010abfe65734f84862.png" width="811" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Inadequate tooling can have a significant impact on software development speed and communication effectiveness. When tools like self-hosted Rocket Chat or Jira (which were a must-have) are unstable or offline, it can disrupt the flow of work and impede collaboration among team members. Developers may be unable to access important information or communicate with their colleagues, leading to delays and confusion. Additionally, when tooling is unreliable, it can erode trust and morale among team members, further hampering productivity.</p><p>To ensure that software development is efficient and effective, it's essential to have robust and reliable tools in place that can support the needs of the team. This may include using cloud-based solutions or outsourcing the hosting and maintenance of these tools to a third-party provider.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="not-invented-here-syndrome">Not invented here syndrome<a href="#not-invented-here-syndrome" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Not invented here syndrome" title="Direct link to Not invented here syndrome">​</a></h2><p>Following "not invented here" practices can lead to less effective processes, higher maintenance costs, and opportunity costs. These practices involve rejecting or avoiding ideas or solutions that were developed externally, instead opting to develop similar solutions internally.</p><p>Internal solutions may require significant resources to maintain and update, leading to higher costs over time.</p><p>At the start of the project, I suggested that we switch from our self-hosted Rocket Chat tool to Slack or a similar program, and abandon our slow, problematic self-hosted Jira installation; this suggestion was not well received by the team.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="getting-access--credentials-for-anything-takes-from-weeks-to-months">Getting access / credentials for anything takes from weeks to months<a href="#getting-access--credentials-for-anything-takes-from-weeks-to-months" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Getting access / credentials for anything takes from weeks to months" title="Direct link to Getting access / credentials for anything takes from weeks to months">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Turtle" src="/blog/assets/images/img4-15ecbadb4a02bc3ce0650c213affd80f.png" width="960" height="638" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Bureaucratic processes can have a significant negative impact on software development teams.</p><p>These processes often require extensive (and often outdated) documentation to be read and understood, creating confusion and delays. Additionally, navigating the complex hierarchy of approval and authorization needed to gain access to resources can be time-consuming and frustrating.</p><p>Lastly, bureaucratic processes can limit the ability to quickly access necessary documentation for troubleshooting purposes, leading to additional costs and delays.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lack-of-transparency---no-estimations-for-work-needed-to-be-done">Lack of transparency - no estimations for work needed to be done<a href="#lack-of-transparency---no-estimations-for-work-needed-to-be-done" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lack of transparency - no estimations for work needed to be done" title="Direct link to Lack of transparency - no estimations for work needed to be done">​</a></h2><p>The team was struggling with a lack of transparency. They were not properly estimating project tasks, which led to delayed deliveries and a high number of tasks that were simply too big to be carried to completion. This resulted in extra-long delivery times and a lot of frustration for team members.</p><p>The team's lack of transparency was causing a lot of problems. They were not communicating effectively with each other or with their stakeholders, and as a result, they were not able to deliver projects on time. They were also not able to manage their workload effectively, which led to a lot of stress and burnout among team members.</p><p>In order to solve this problem, the team needed to start estimating project tasks more accurately. They also needed to start communicating more effectively with each other and with their stakeholders. This would help them better manage their workload and deliver projects on time.</p><p>To do this, the team decided to start using a project management tool that would help us estimate project tasks more accurately. We also decided to start holding regular team meetings to discuss progress and make sure everyone was on the same page.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bringing-more-and-more-people-to-solve-quality-issues-with-quantity-approach">Bringing more and more people to solve quality issues with quantity approach<a href="#bringing-more-and-more-people-to-solve-quality-issues-with-quantity-approach" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Bringing more and more people to solve quality issues with quantity approach" title="Direct link to Bringing more and more people to solve quality issues with quantity approach">​</a></h2><p>The software development team was in trouble.  Despite being composed of skilled and experienced engineers, we were struggling to deliver projects on time and within budget. The root cause of this problem was a lack of effective and transparent processes.</p><p>The team had no clear guidelines for how to approach a project, and there was a lack of communication between team members. This resulted in confusion and delays, as team members were not sure what was expected of them. Additionally, there was a lack of accountability, as team members were not held responsible for their actions.</p><p>In an effort to fix this problem, the company decided to bring in more external people to the project. They believed that these new team members would bring fresh perspectives and new ideas to the table. However, this decision only made things worse.</p><p>The new team members had to spend a significant amount of time getting up to speed on the project. They had to learn about the company's processes, the existing codebase, and the project's requirements. This ramp-up time slowed down the project even more, as the new team members were not able to contribute to the project right away.</p><p>The team's lack of effective and transparent processes also made it difficult for the new team members to understand what was happening on the project. They were not sure who to go to for help, and they were not sure how to communicate with the rest of the team.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="enforce-using-immature-in-house-developed-abstractions">Enforce using immature in-house developed abstractions<a href="#enforce-using-immature-in-house-developed-abstractions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Enforce using immature in-house developed abstractions" title="Direct link to Enforce using immature in-house developed abstractions">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="In-house abstractions" src="/blog/assets/images/img5-bd843381eb731c6a845942cef692859c.png" width="2041" height="660" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In-house abstractions are a common (anti)pattern</p><p>When a large company enforces internal software development teams to use software abstractions that hide complexities of the Cloud configuration, or enforce using in-house unstable and low-quality shared libraries, it can have negative effects on the delivery time and product quality.</p><p>This can lead to delays in delivery and lower satisfaction among the development team. Additionally, the use of abstractions can make it more difficult for developers to understand and troubleshoot issues, leading to increased frustration and a decrease in productivity.</p><p>Furthermore, using in-house shared libraries of low-quality can result in bugs and errors that can be difficult to fix, further delaying delivery and lowering product quality.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-actions-we-took-to-improve-the-situation">The actions we took to improve the situation<a href="#the-actions-we-took-to-improve-the-situation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The actions we took to improve the situation" title="Direct link to The actions we took to improve the situation">​</a></h2><p>As you can see, there were a number of concerns that needed to be addressed. I then sat down with the rest of the team to discuss our current situation and our future course of action. How can we handle each of these concerns? The list of specific steps we took to advance the project is below.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="evolution-instead-of-revolution">Evolution instead of revolution<a href="#evolution-instead-of-revolution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Evolution instead of revolution" title="Direct link to Evolution instead of revolution">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Evolution" src="/blog/assets/images/img6-3e77c6c4b24cdfd177e1e17bb63ef47a.png" width="960" height="540" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Performing a major transformation within the automotive industry can be a challenging task, but it is essential to plan for evolution rather than revolution. A compact approach that focuses on gradual changes will be more effective in achieving the desired outcome.</p><p>When transforming a company, it's important to keep in mind that there may be resistance to changes from employees and stakeholders. This can be due to a lack of willingness to change the status quo or a fear of the unknown. It's crucial to address these concerns and work towards building a shared vision for the future.</p><p>One way to approach this is by involving employees and stakeholders in the planning process. This allows them to feel a sense of ownership and commitment to the changes that are being made. It's also important to communicate the benefits of the transformation clearly and consistently. This will help to build buy-in and support for the changes that are being made.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="using-project-management-tooling-jira-azure-devops">Using project management tooling: JIRA, Azure DEVOPS<a href="#using-project-management-tooling-jira-azure-devops" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Using project management tooling: JIRA, Azure DEVOPS" title="Direct link to Using project management tooling: JIRA, Azure DEVOPS">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" alt="What should we do" src="/blog/assets/images/img7-8e564ed92a1d8f5a5f47fa829c5671b1.png" width="1243" height="546" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>At the very start, since there wasn’t anything to kick the project off, we operated without any plan or organization. The product owner had a rough idea that needed to be worked on, and that was all there was.</p><p>First, we organized the work in an iterative manner, by deciding to follow Scrum methodology. We decided to have two-week sprints. We still didn’t have any tools at hand, so we started with a shared document. We wrote some task titles, and next to them, we wrote the names of developers who would like to tackle them. This was the way we did things in the first sprint.</p><p>After a while, which was to be expected, such a rudimentary process became a bottleneck, so we decided that we should start using self-hosted Jira (provided by the client), which helped increase the transparency of what we do.</p><p>This has already helped tremendously. As this tool was self-hosted, it suffered stability issues, so we went for a similar tool, Azure DevOps, which has been very stable since then, and it’s still being used on the project.</p><p>We experienced the following benefits by using these project management tools:</p><p>Improved collaboration: These tools allow team members to work together more effectively, by providing a centralized location for project information and communication.</p><p>Increased visibility: With project management tooling, it is easier to keep track of project progress, identify issues, and make adjustments as needed. This can help teams to stay on schedule and deliver projects on time.</p><p>Better organization: Project management tooling can help teams to better organize tasks, assign responsibilities, and manage resources. This can improve efficiency and reduce the risk of errors.</p><p>Enhanced reporting: These tools typically provide detailed reporting and analytics, which can be used to gain insights into project performance and make data-driven decisions.</p><p>Improved communication: With project management tooling, it is easier to keep stakeholders informed about project progress and status. This can help to build trust and improve the working relationship between different teams and departments.</p><p>Streamlined workflows: These tools can help to automate repetitive tasks and streamline workflows, making it easier to manage projects and free up team members to focus on more important work.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="using-own-aws--azure-subscriptions-rather-then-a-client-provided-on-premise-solution">Using own AWS / Azure subscriptions, rather then a client-provided on premise solution<a href="#using-own-aws--azure-subscriptions-rather-then-a-client-provided-on-premise-solution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Using own AWS / Azure subscriptions, rather then a client-provided on premise solution" title="Direct link to Using own AWS / Azure subscriptions, rather then a client-provided on premise solution">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" alt="AWS &amp;amp; Azure" src="/blog/assets/images/img8-10c5bb9ccb4e8b59f2a4afad6b58b2e4.png" width="935" height="297" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>At the start of the project, our team was offered that some other team at the client site manages our infrastructure for us. This was a on-premise solution. This, clearly, could sound reasonable - that someone else volunteers to take part of your problem on themselves - but this was something we didn’t want to happen for a couple of reasons:</p><p>More often than not, in-house teams do not have such level of technical expertise compared to engineering force at Microsoft, Google, etc.</p><p>It’s not a rare case that the documentation doesn’t exist, or it’s very poor</p><p>Major cloud vendors are faster with integrating tools, such as for instance Kubernetes, than the in-house teams.</p><p>Solutions offered by in-house teams have been tested on a much smaller number of customers, so the quality of services offered is significantly lower then the ones provided by major cloud providers.</p><p>We went for the Azure cloud, which offers many advantages over an on-premise, self-managed solution. Most notably, the ability to scale quickly and elastically as your business needs change. With Azure, you can quickly deploy virtual machines and other services on demand with a few clicks of a button and only pay for what you use. Additionally, since all the infrastructure is managed in the cloud, you don’t have to worry about server maintenance or patching of software updates which can eat up valuable time and resources. Finally, Microsoft provides a wide range of services that are tailored to meet any need, from big data analytics to content delivery networks, along with access to their global network of data centers, ensuring high availability for mission-critical workloads.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="from-nothing-via-self-hosted-gitlab-to-github">From nothing, via self-hosted GitLab to GitHub<a href="#from-nothing-via-self-hosted-gitlab-to-github" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to From nothing, via self-hosted GitLab to GitHub" title="Direct link to From nothing, via self-hosted GitLab to GitHub">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" alt="GitLab vs GitHub" src="/blog/assets/images/img9-f1452f0e312158ec6ac856bec39fe6df.png" width="1671" height="381" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The project kicked off with no place where our source-code could be stored. Our external DevOps consultant proposed that we start with self-hosting a GitLab instance. This allows us to have the flexibility of configuring it to fit our needs. We began using the system and were generally content with it, however, we encountered some occasional interruptions in service. This forced us to think about a more stable solution that could boost our productivity.</p><p>After talking within our team, I came up with proposal to give GitHub and GitHub Actions a try. It became quickly evident that this was the best course of action to take.</p><p>It enabled us to collaborate on projects with team members located around the world. All code changes are tracked by Github, and it's easy to see exactly who changed what, when they made the change, and any comments that were left with the update. This helped ensure quality control is maintained at all times during development cycles. GitHub Actions helped our developers save time with repetitive tasks such as running tests or deploying builds.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="full-automation-with-iaac-terraform-and-github-actions">Full automation with IaaC, terraform and GitHub Actions<a href="#full-automation-with-iaac-terraform-and-github-actions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Full automation with IaaC, terraform and GitHub Actions" title="Direct link to Full automation with IaaC, terraform and GitHub Actions">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IaaC" src="/blog/assets/images/img10-e6c7fe36dc081b2161d622163d29f549.png" width="2042" height="910" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Some practices of our client, at the time I joined the project, were that the applications were quite often managed manually, which made us face the following challenges:</p><p>Reduced Visibility: As changes are made manually or using different tools, they can easily go unnoticed, which can cause unexpected issues or conflicts.</p><p>Manual Updates: Keeping systems up to date and maintaining a consistent configuration requires manual updates, which can be time consuming and prone to errors due to human error.</p><p>Security Vulnerabilities: Without automation and version control that Infrastructure as Code provides, outdated software and configurations put the system at risk of security vulnerabilities that could allow malicious actors access to the system and data it stores or processes.</p><p>Poor Scalability: When building systems without Infrastructure as Code, resources become more limited when you need them most - such as during times of increased user demand or when changing business needs demand a larger scale solution than you have currently in place.</p><p>The team went for Infrastructure as Code (IaaC), and the tool we used for it was Terraform, which helped us manage both of our clouds - the AWS one and the Azure one. We built pipelines that would validate any changes made to the infrastructure, and automatically deploy it to our environments using GitHub Actions, so we eliminated the need for someone to be in charge of doing this manually.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>As a conclusion, this blog post urges you to use cutting-edge software engineering techniques in areas that are technically stale.

What exactly do they mean? In the sentences that follow, we'll talk about it briefly.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-poc">What is POC?<a href="#what-is-poc" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is POC?" title="Direct link to What is POC?">​</a></h2><p>To start off. Both are done at the early stages of software development (or product development in general). But they have very different goals.</p><p>POC (Proof-of-Concept) will prove (duh!) if the idea is technically feasible and useful enough. MVP (Minimum Viable Product) will minimise time and effort and let you see if there is a place in the market for your idea.</p><p>A POC is a prototype or a minimal viable version of a product or service that is used to test and confirm whether an idea or concept is feasible. It serves primarily as an example of <strong>how the concept is possible</strong> and can be effectively implemented. A POC is often constructed with the very minimum set of features and functionalities necessary <strong>to demonstrate the viability of the concept</strong>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-mvp">What is MVP?<a href="#what-is-mvp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is MVP?" title="Direct link to What is MVP?">​</a></h2><p>An MVP, on the other hand, is a product or service that provides the bare minimum of features and <strong>functionalities required to satisfy early clients and collect feedback for further development</strong>. An MVP, as opposed to a POC, is the final product or service that has been provided to a small number of clients for testing and feedback. With the intention of learning from client input and using that learning to iterate and improve the product, the MVP is created to be a minimum viable version of the product that <strong>can be built and launched rapidly</strong>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-what-is-the-difference-between-poc-and-mvp">So what is the difference between POC and MVP?<a href="#so-what-is-the-difference-between-poc-and-mvp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to So what is the difference between POC and MVP?" title="Direct link to So what is the difference between POC and MVP?">​</a></h2><p>In conclusion, a POC is used to determine whether an <strong>idea is possible</strong>, and an MVP is a <strong>completed product</strong> or service that has the bare minimum of features necessary to be offered to clients. MVP is considered a step further than POC. As an example, your initial proof-of-concept for a lemon stand may be a simple setup consisting of a plastic table with a manual juicer placed in front of your garage. However, the minimum viable product (MVP) would be a fully operational, legally registered business that complies with hygiene regulations, operating out of a rented commercial space and using an electric juicer.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-an-example-of-a-poc">What is an example of a POC?<a href="#what-is-an-example-of-a-poc" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is an example of a POC?" title="Direct link to What is an example of a POC?">​</a></h2><p>Imagine you discover an opportunity. You have connections with farmers who raise crickets, grasshoppers and mealworms. One day, you read about the growing popularity of edible insects in your city. You even meet someone who expresses interest in trying them but can't find a reliable source. This is an opportunity to build a business by connecting the dots between these two needs.</p><p>The first step would not be to create an online store with complex features like user registration, pictures of insects, ratings, vouchers, and loyalty programs. Instead, you would start by creating a simple spreadsheet to keep track of your insect farmers in one column, their stock in another column, and possibly prices in a third column. This would serve as your database. Then, you would open a new spreadsheet to store information about your clients, orders, and transactions. This would serve as your proof-of-concept.</p><p>If this process proves successful, and you are able to match customers with farmers, you have the beginnings of a business. The next step would be to create a minimum viable product (MVP).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-an-example-of-an-mvp">What is an example of an MVP?<a href="#what-is-an-example-of-an-mvp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is an example of an MVP?" title="Direct link to What is an example of an MVP?">​</a></h2><p>Based on the results of your proof-of-concept, you now understand the minimum set of features required to meet the needs of your early customers.</p><p>Your customers currently need to inquire about what is available before they place an order. Therefore, the MVP would be a website that displays up-to-date information about the insects currently available and a button to place orders.</p><p>At this stage, it is not necessary to implement a user database, secure management panel or a fraud detection system. Before expanding the feature set of your MVP, it is important to determine if each feature is a necessary addition or just a desirable one.</p><p>After launching your MVP, you can gather feedback from customers and add additional features that enhance its appeal. For example, if users request the ability to view their order history, you can add a login feature that allows them to save their orders. If customers ask for a wishlist, you can add a wishlist feature.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>A proof-of-concept is a basic and not a long-term way to evaluate the feasibility of an idea. If it proves viable, you can then create a minimum viable product (MVP) to meet the needs of your customers. From there, you can gradually build and improve upon your MVP to create a full-fledged product. That's why it's important to make sure your MVP is scalable and sustainable from the start. This can be challenging, and it is often beneficial to seek the advice of experts.</p><p>Please let me know if you find this article useful and reach out to me if you have any questions about where to begin with your MVP.</p>]]></content>

That’s exactly what this blog post is about - we will give you concrete examples of some frequently used terms, presented in an easy-to-understand manner.</p><p>So, without further ado, let's get started with the examples.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="api">API<a href="#api" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to API" title="Direct link to API">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="API" src="/blog/assets/images/img1-31b0a31097d31e4982e1d58754851325.png" width="1641" height="861" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Building applications on top of existing APIs</p><p>Stands for <strong>A</strong>pplication <strong>P</strong>rogramming <strong>I</strong>nterface. Interface being a point where two systems, subjects, organizations, etc. meet and interact. API in simple terms means any kind of utility that can be
consumed by other applications.</p><p>You may come up with an idea to build an alternative UI for managing GitHub Pull Requests to the one provided by github.com. To achieve that, you can integrate with the pull requests API from GitHub, and present the
data coming from this API.</p><p>Another example may be building a command line utility, where you want to find the biggest file on your computer, where you need to interact with the File-system API to get this information.</p><p>Most of modern Web applications are designed so, that a Front-end application (say ReactJS) is connected to a backend API, to get or update / delete some data.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="docker-containers">Docker containers<a href="#docker-containers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Docker containers" title="Direct link to Docker containers">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docker containers" src="/blog/assets/images/img2-36b1387b09ba2c3ea3033c3265275e01.png" width="1953" height="917" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>A technology which can be installed on any modern Operating System with a purpose of packaging your entire applications for easier usability.</p><p>In order to package your application as a Docker container, you need to supply a file describing how to install all the dependencies that your application has, as well as the command that
needs to be executed to get you application up and running.</p><p>Once this file (most often named <code>Dockerfile</code>) is prepared, docker tool allows you to build an image of your application, which can be then pushed into many image registries out there
(i.e. <a href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://hub.docker.com/</a>, Amazon Container Registry, etc)</p><p>After the image has been pushed to a registry of your choice, anyone that has an access to the image repository can run your application.
Without containerization technology, you would have to worry about all the challenges when installing and running software on many operating systems.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="version-control--git">Version control / Git<a href="#version-control--git" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Version control / Git" title="Direct link to Version control / Git">​</a></h2><p>Version control refers to the ability to control the versions of the digital artifacts, whatever it may be (e-books, word docs, mp3 files...).</p><p>In the software development sense, we're talking about the ability to manage versions of our software, as we change it.</p><p>Version control systems do not need to be exclusively used for code management: we can use it to version our images, word documents or any kind of digital artifact.</p><p>The advantage of versioning is the ability to track the progress of some software product, but also by versioning we have a chance to easily jump from version to version and that
may come handy in case we introduce a bug in version <code>1.4.2</code>, but luckily we know that a version <code>1.4.1</code> worked just fine.</p><p>Git is a cross-platform software which technically enables us to manage software changes, by creating new versions. Git is not the only technology that can be used for
versioning your software, but has become kind of industry standard, due to it’s flexibility, speed and it’s distributed model.</p><p>Git as the software is what behind the scene powers services, such as GitHub.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="open-source">Open-Source<a href="#open-source" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Open-Source" title="Direct link to Open-Source">​</a></h2><p>Every piece of software is based on some source-code that was written for it to be able to execute. There are 2 kinds of the source-code:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="closed-source">Closed-source<a href="#closed-source" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Closed-source" title="Direct link to Closed-source">​</a></h3><p>Examples of these would be Windows Operating System code-base, MacOS one, etc. Closed-source is mostly developed by the companies which do not want to publish their source-code,
because the code is their competitive advantage, and brings them financial income.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="open-source-1">Open-source<a href="#open-source-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Open-source" title="Direct link to Open-source">​</a></h3><p>The opposite side, which promotes values of public visibility of the code, so that everyone can access and view it. An additional step is an ability for everyone to change the code.
This lead to the enormous popularity of public tools, such as GitHub, which provide an easy way for people to collaborate on software projects as well as to share code from each other.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="merge--pull-requests">Merge / Pull requests<a href="#merge--pull-requests" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Merge / Pull requests" title="Direct link to Merge / Pull requests">​</a></h2><p>Pull requests is a formal process of contributing to the existing code-base. It helps ensuring that any code change that needs to be made, gets verified by experienced engineers.
The process looks something like this:</p><ul><li>There is an existing software code-base</li><li><strong>User A</strong> wants to extend existing functionality / fix existing bug</li><li>(S)he <strong>prepares a bugfix or a feature</strong> on own development machine</li><li>There is a <strong>User B</strong> who is considered a project maintainer (the one who knows the project well and ensures its quality)</li><li><strong>User A</strong> informs <strong>User B</strong> that (s)he wants the new feature/bugfix integrated integrated into existing code-base, which is a formal process (most often) performed using Web UIs provided
by the source-code hosting platform, e.g Github, Gitlab, BitBucket, etc, where the code is hosted.</li><li>The pull request then usually goes through a <strong>series of improvements</strong>, until it’s ready to be merged</li><li>After being merged, the new feature or bugfix is successfully integrated into the code-base</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="merge-conflicts">Merge conflicts<a href="#merge-conflicts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Merge conflicts" title="Direct link to Merge conflicts">​</a></h2><p>Working in a collaborative environment sometimes lead to a situation when two team members want to change the same line(s) of code, for different reasons. Let’s illustrate the problem</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Merge conflicts" src="/blog/assets/images/img3-fccbc617caa1b04a7521e38479e71f93.png" width="1290" height="656" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Merge conflicts happen in the situation where there’s an existing code base (Nameprinter.kt in this example), and there are two developers, which <strong>want to update the same line(s) of code</strong>.
In the case from the image above we have a name variable defined, in the current file version, and we have two attempts to change it: the one to make it hold ”Merry” and the other one to hold ”Jack” value.</p><p>So, the two developers happily commit code in their local repositories,  and want to push their code to the main branch, which contains tested and stable code.
The first developer that wants to merge her changes into the main branch will have no issues with this at all. Let’s say that <code>val name = "Merry"</code> is what we now have in the main branch.
But, what happens when the second developer wants to push her change to the repo? Well, let’s say we’re using Git Version Control. With an attempt to push the change from the second developer, Git will report that the second developer is running slightly behind the server, and that the changes on the server need to be pulled locally, and then the second developer can push to code to the main branch.</p><p>At this moment the <strong>merge conflict</strong> will occur, giving a clear signal to the second developer that she <strong>needs to decide</strong> what should be the content of the problematic line. The second developer <strong>most often</strong>
needs to discuss with the person that contributed to the conflicting line, to find the adequate solution. Once there’s a solution agreed upon, the second developer can <strong>resolve the merge conflict</strong> and push her
changes to the central repository.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="synchronous--asynchronous-execution">Synchronous / asynchronous execution<a href="#synchronous--asynchronous-execution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Synchronous / asynchronous execution" title="Direct link to Synchronous / asynchronous execution">​</a></h2><p>Synchronous might be more easily understood if we use term blocking instead. Some things need to be synchronous/blocking by their nature. Imagine you have a sample code:</p><div class="language-kotlin codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#bfc7d5;--prism-background-color:#292d3e"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-kotlin codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">function </span><span class="token function" style="color:rgb(130, 170, 255)">completeCheckout</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">(</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">)</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">{</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">    </span><span class="token function" style="color:rgb(130, 170, 255)">storeOrderInDb</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">(</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">)</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">;</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token comment" style="color:rgb(105, 112, 152);font-style:italic">// takes 2s</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">    </span><span class="token function" style="color:rgb(130, 170, 255)">transferToOrderManagementSystem</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">(</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">)</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">;</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token comment" style="color:rgb(105, 112, 152);font-style:italic">// takes 3s</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">    </span><span class="token function" style="color:rgb(130, 170, 255)">sendConfirmationMail</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">(</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">)</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">;</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token comment" style="color:rgb(105, 112, 152);font-style:italic">// takes 3s</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">}</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>Ideally, we should not design our systems to be synchronous / blocking. If, in the example from above, we decide that all 3 functions <code>storeOrderInDb</code>, <code>transferToOrderManagementSystem</code> and <code>sendConfirmationMail</code>
are synchronous, than user will have to wait 8 seconds in total until he gets a response from the server.</p><p>If you, instead, decide that only the first method, storeOrderInDb is synchronous, and other 2 aren't, that means that user will have to wait only 2 seconds, until his order is successfully stored in the database,
and his order will eventually be sent to order management system and he will get a confirmation e-mail (this can wait a bit, and the user doesn't need to get this done immediately).</p><p>A good rule of thumb would be that we should design for asynchronous, and the user should not be blocked unless there is a valid reason to do it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="software-versioning">Software versioning<a href="#software-versioning" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Software versioning" title="Direct link to Software versioning">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Software versioning" src="/blog/assets/images/img4-ce454a7de5e62a4143116b0975e341b9.png" width="1500" height="1112" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Software evolves over time.</p><p>It gets bugs fixed and new features added, as well. It can be that, for whatever reason, some user wants to use the first version of our application, two years old, whereas some other user wants to use the latest one.
We need a way to store our updated software alongside its version somehow.</p><p>There are a couple of versioning schemas, <u><a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semantic versioning</a></u> being one of them with high adoption.</p><p>One additional reason to have versioning schema in place is an easier way to roll back some software that contains a bug for example, to a previous, known to work version. So, if we have rolled application version
<code>1.2.3</code>, and we want to roll it back, we could simply, from our software registry pull the version <code>1.2.2</code> and roll it out to the customers.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="logging">Logging<a href="#logging" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Logging" title="Direct link to Logging">​</a></h2><p>When developing our applications (mostly backend systems), it's very important that during the application runtime execution we preserve some sort of messages containing important information about a system or user behavior.</p><p>An example would be that if a user enters 3 times wrong login credentials we store this message so that we can troubleshoot/diagnose given use-case. The recommended way of doing it would be writing these messages to the
standard out (console), which can later be searched through when needed.</p><p>Another case would be that in case our code talks to the database, and there's a connectivity issue, we could store the message, something along the lines: "There was a connection timeout connecting to the database x.y.z".</p><p>Often, these logging libraries contain various logging levels, such as <code>DEBUG</code>, <code>INFO</code>, <code>FATAL</code> which help us set the importance of the things we are logging: we can then, for instance, filter logs which are considered
<code>FATAL</code> and then do the analysis and the troubleshooting.</p><p>Often you want to enable <code>DEBUG</code> level logging on your dev environment, so that you can additionally assert if everything runs as expected, and use <code>WARN</code>/<code>FATAL</code> level on your production, to avoid noise, and see only
issues in the runtime.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="json">JSON<a href="#json" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to JSON" title="Direct link to JSON">​</a></h2><p>JSON is a human-readable and a portable data serialization format . It's famous for being used for a data interchange between browsers and servers, but not exclusive to that.</p><p>An example of JSON serialized (formatted) data would be:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="JSON" src="/blog/assets/images/img5-970374c5daca50ca548e071b46551d9a.png" width="1500" height="1088" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>JSON provides a couple of data types, such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, and all of them together are enough to express any sort of data, which is one of the reasons
why it's heavily used (apart from human readability).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="request--response">Request / Response<a href="#request--response" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Request / Response" title="Direct link to Request / Response">​</a></h2><p>Very popular interaction model between two (software) parties, where one side (client) initiates the communication by sending <strong>a request</strong> to the other party (server) which upon
understanding and processing the request sends <strong>a response</strong> back to the client. Very often you’ll hear HTTP Request / HTTP Response which is a specialized case where such
communication going over the network, using HTTP protocol.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="scalability">Scalability<a href="#scalability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Scalability" title="Direct link to Scalability">​</a></h2><p>A frequently used term is software scalability, which is an ability of the software to cope with the ever-increasing load, often as consequence of an increased number of users using
the software at the same time. Applications should be designed in such a way to be able to handle the increased load in a reasonable manner, by responding to the user in as short
amount of time as possible, or, when not possible, informing the user that the system is experiencing high load, and that the requests can’t be fulfilled.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="abstraction">Abstraction<a href="#abstraction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Abstraction" title="Direct link to Abstraction">​</a></h2><p>You will very frequently come across this term, as you progress in your career. Abstraction is a fancy name for hiding some complexity under some name.

There are many database solutions out there, optimized for particular use-cases.</p><p>Databases ensure that the data we put there stays there as long as they are needed. Often, these databases ensure that the data persisted is also backed up, to ensure there's no data loss.</p><p>Apart from the ability to store the data, the databases provide a way to query the data and access it.</p><p>Two very popular types of databases nowadays are relational and document databases. The have different use-cases when one should use them, and some examples of concrete technologies implementing these types are PostgreSQL on a relational side, or MongoDB on the relation side.</p><p>Associated with databases is the so-called CRUD acronym. It refers to Create, Read, Update and Delete, that are the actions we can perform over database entries.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="http">HTTP<a href="#http" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to HTTP" title="Direct link to HTTP">​</a></h2><p>Means for reliable exchange of text-based, human and machine-readable content between different applications.</p><p>The core of HTTP communication is the client/server and request/response pairs. The communication goes like:</p><p>HTTP client application (say, your browser) sends a HTTP Request to a remote HTTP server</p><p>HTTP Server receives the request, and responds with a HTTP response, which then client handles in some way.</p><p>An example of the HTTP communication would be the one between a browser and a server needed to fetch resources for rendering web page: html documents, css styles, JavaScrtipt scripts, Ajax requests, etc.</p><p>HTTP contains a server host name, request and response headers, depending on use-case request and / or response body, cookies etc.</p><p>HTTP supports the concept of verbs, such as <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>DELETE</code> which provides a way to express more clearly what do try to do with the remote resource, like getting some resource, deleting it, and so on.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rest-api">Rest API<a href="#rest-api" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Rest API" title="Direct link to Rest API">​</a></h2><p>Rest API is layer sitting on top of aforementioned HTTP protocol, and is based on the concept of resources.</p><p>Rest API, like any other API, is used to build applications by integrating with them. In this case, integration is done using an HTTP client.</p><p>Many popular platforms today, like Facebook, Twitter or Github provide their APIs, which they use themselves (e.g. Facebook website or their Android and IOS mobile applications are consuming Facebook API itself), but also to be consumed by the others (above some limit you get charged for it).</p><p>As mentioned, resources are a central concept in the Rest API world. One resource can be (let's use Github API as an example) a repository, and Github API states that we can manage particular repository via their APIs, by accessing particular URLs and sending correct input data using proper HTTP verbs.</p><p>Apart from Rest APIs, there are also emerging GraphQL APIs, which are also sitting on top of HTTP protocols but differ in philosophy of how the data should be accessed and managed.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ide">IDE<a href="#ide" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to IDE" title="Direct link to IDE">​</a></h2><p>Stands for Integrated Development Environment, which is a piece of software used to develop applications.

This is more like general idea, and there are couple of concrete methodologies adhering to these principles, such as: Scrum, Kanban, etc.</p><p>The idea is that software should be changed frequently, in small increments, so that each increment can be validated by the user as soon as possible.</p><p>By being able to frequently release smaller software increments, we can get the feedback from the users, but also we are able to more easily recover from the bugs we may have introduced (since the scope of small changes allows for easier troubleshooting).</p><p>You may also hear about tools such as Jira, Azure DevOps or ClickUp, which help simplifying your software development flow.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="testing">Testing<a href="#testing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Testing" title="Direct link to Testing">​</a></h2><p>Testing is the formal process of asserting software quality. Ideally, we want to test the things ourselves, before we hand our software to our customers. In general, we have two types of tests:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="manual">Manual<a href="#manual" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Manual" title="Direct link to Manual">​</a></h3><p>Manual testing involves 1 or more people testing applications by hand, by interacting with, for instance, a mobile application, or browser-based websites, by going through a series of scenarios (use-cases) and asserting that what was expected happened. This testing category is very expensive, and error-prone on top (anything involving people is risky), so it should be minimized.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="automated">Automated<a href="#automated" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Automated" title="Direct link to Automated">​</a></h3><p>This group of tests should be the desired way to test the software before releasing it. The idea is to write a set of tests that can be executed by machines, thus they will be much faster and less risky than when performed by people.</p><p>One test, implemented in some programming language (let's say Python), interacts with our software, gets the results of that interaction, and asserts that results match expectations of such an interaction.</p><p>These automated tests can further be divided in <strong>unit tests</strong>, <strong>integration tests</strong> (there's no consensus on what types of tests should exist and how should they be named at the time being)</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-tip alert alert--success admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span>tip</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>One important thing to note is that testing reveals presence of bugs, not their absence.

Technically speaking, debugging is a mode in which we can start the application so that we can inspect its behavior during the execution. There is also a concept of breakpoints, which are the points in code (concrete lines in source files) where we would like to pause application execution.</p><p>How it works:</p><ul><li><p>Set a breakpoint in a source file's concrete line you'd like to pause your application's execution</p></li><li><p>Trigger an application flow that would cause the line you set to be executed</p></li><li><p>When the execution reaches your line, it will pause there, giving you control to:</p><ul><li><p>resume it</p></li><li><p>inspect all the variables (global, local)</p></li><li><p>continue debugging line by line</p></li><li><p>step into functions...</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>This is mostly used by developers on their machines, but sometimes it's also possible to debug processes running on remote machines.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="compiling">Compiling<a href="#compiling" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Compiling" title="Direct link to Compiling">​</a></h2><p>There are programming languages, such as JavaScript for instance, where a JavaScript engine can directly execute the lines of code you wrote. This is for instance your browser, or a NodeJS.</p><p>On the other hand, many programming languages (such as Java or C#) require us to create an intermediary representation of code, which is both required and optimized for the runtime and is the representation that is required to run the applications written in these languages.</p><p>For instance, in case of Java programming language, we need to transform Java source code files into Java bytecode files. These are later used to run our application using Java runtime environment.</p><p>Pre-compiled code representations tend to be highly optimized for the platform which executes the code, leading to greater security and performance.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="client--server">Client / Server<a href="#client--server" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Client / Server" title="Direct link to Client / Server">​</a></h2><p>This is one interaction model (out of a few ones) between the two software parties (processes) where:</p><p>client is a party which <strong>initiates communication</strong> with the server</p><p>server is the party which <strong>responds to the requests</strong> sent by the client</p><p>This interaction model you can find, for instance, in web browsers, where the client (the browser itself) requests web resources from the web-server (which is server in this case)</p><p>Servers never initiate this interaction.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="deployment">Deployment<a href="#deployment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Deployment" title="Direct link to Deployment">​</a></h2><p>Deployment is a process of installing your software on a server, making it available for end-users. Deployment frequency and duration can vary significantly between different applications, depending on software complexity, a technical debt of the applications, deployment tooling efficiency, etc.</p><p>There are companies which are deploying their software several times a day, whereas some companies deploy very rarely, once in a month, or even less often.</p><p>The deployment should, ideally, be an automated process, consisting of various testing phases, packaging and versioning software release, installing it on a server, and performing some health checks to ensure the success of the deployment</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="caching">Caching<a href="#caching" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Caching" title="Direct link to Caching">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Caching" src="/blog/assets/images/img7-d5daf929f0b827b147f1401ea6b88f27.png" width="1903" height="824" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Caching is a process of remembering values of some time-taking or resource expensive computations so that they can be reused for the subsequent, identical calls.</p><p>In some systems, querying a database is a very expensive operation time-wise, and we might want to cache some results that can be cached.</p><p>For instance, imagine we have an e-commerce platform, and we want to present categories to the users, which are coming from a database. These categories are not changing so frequently, so we might want to protect our database server being querying each time each page is displayed for each user by caching these results once they are returned from the database the first time.</p><p>We often store this cached value in server memory, or we can put this information to the external tools, such as Redis or similar, which have much better read performance than the databases.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>It's not easy to start a career as a software engineer. We simply need to be familiar with too many concepts.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Example banner" src="/blog/assets/images/img-c90ed13cfffe30d6593903fc37404c38.png" width="2158" height="1213" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Communication is the key. Do this right and your project will succeed. I will expose 3 big risks in software projects and tell you how to avoid them. Follow these suggestions and your chances will massively improve.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-unclear-expectations">1. Unclear Expectations<a href="#1-unclear-expectations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Unclear Expectations" title="Direct link to 1. Unclear Expectations">​</a></h2><p>Unclear expectations are dangerous. They can be very expensive at the least or disastrous at worst. Yet, they are not uncommon.
Teams spend hundreds of hours of effort to create a value that no one asked for. Unclear expectations can lead to lost money or jobs.</p><p>Unclear expectations are normal, though. They will happen more often than not. And if they do, don’t see them as mistakes, offense or
incompetence of yours or others. Everyone is unique, grew up in a different environment and was exposed to different experiences. All of
us think differently and see different things as “obvious” or “self explanatory”.</p><p>Miscommunication will happen. And that is a good thing. Let it happen. It will expose imperfections in your communication process and
will give you a chance to improve it. But it is very important to not ignore miscommunication. Unclear expectations are usually easy to
fix but require efforts on both sides: the stakeholder and the provider.</p><p>To avoid the risk of unclear expectations it is enough to come up with a proper SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) in the form of a checklist.</p><p>An example of the first checklist looks like this:</p><ul><li><p>What outcome do I expect?</p></li><li><p>Will I be happy with anything less?</p></li><li><p>Why do I expect this particular outcome?</p></li><li><p>What constraints there are?</p></li><li><p>Ask what is possible.</p></li></ul><p>Follow this simple list and you will save yourself many headaches. Detailed explanation with examples comes in next paragraphs.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-outcome-do-i-expect">What outcome do I expect?<a href="#what-outcome-do-i-expect" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What outcome do I expect?" title="Direct link to What outcome do I expect?">​</a></h3><p>Write it down in a short, but very concrete sentence. It should take the form of a thing that already happened, not as an action to do.
e.g. “bank transfer is enabled as a paying method for users in the eurozone” not “enable bank transfer for eurozone”. This is sometimes
called an Acceptance Criteria. And if written properly, leaves no space for interpretation and allows you to test the outcomes (sometimes
even automatically).</p><p>Keep in mind that it is natural for your expectations to change. We will talk about this in depth in the next couple of minutes.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="will-i-be-happy-with-anything-less">Will I be happy with anything less?<a href="#will-i-be-happy-with-anything-less" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Will I be happy with anything less?" title="Direct link to Will I be happy with anything less?">​</a></h3><p>Prepare a simplified expectation. Usually you can solve 80% of the problem with 20% effort. Think about what could be stripped down from your expected outcome. Do you really need this in real-time or is it 4h late enough? Do you really need to sort and filter on every column or maybe just the date? This will prepare you to save the day (and time) once things get hairy during development.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-do-i-expect-this-particular-outcome">Why do I expect this particular outcome?<a href="#why-do-i-expect-this-particular-outcome" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why do I expect this particular outcome?" title="Direct link to Why do I expect this particular outcome?">​</a></h3><p>Write down a sentence or two explaining why this outcome is wanted. This helps you to formalize and validate your expectations. Maybe you will learn something new or change perspective. On top of that, by setting your expectations in a context, you will help others see and understand the problem the way you see it. This reduces the chances of misunderstanding and even gives an opportunity to find alternative solutions to the problem. A good example would be “Our customers demand a bank transfer as a payment method but our current payment provider allows this only for EUR currency”. A bad example is “we need bank transfers as a payment method”.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-constraints-there-are">What constraints there are?<a href="#what-constraints-there-are" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What constraints there are?" title="Direct link to What constraints there are?">​</a></h3><p>Give yourself a minute or two and think about any limitations that apply to your expectations. Maybe you have an important customer onboarding scheduled and the feature must be implemented before this? Communicate this clearly! Every person responsible for delivery must know what constraints there are. Be it financial, technical or simply time constraints.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ask-what-is-possible">Ask what is possible<a href="#ask-what-is-possible" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ask what is possible" title="Direct link to Ask what is possible">​</a></h3><p>Everyone's an expert in her domain. Everywhere else we make assumptions. Do not endanger your success. Ask experts if the expected outcome is possible given the constraints. And if not, ask for the simpler alternative you already prepared.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-changing-requirements">2. Changing Requirements<a href="#2-changing-requirements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Changing Requirements" title="Direct link to 2. Changing Requirements">​</a></h2><p>Requirements change. This is a simple fact. When you mature, your expectations change. Same goes for your features, products and business. Do not fall for the “never change a running system” meme. Why is this a risk, though? Read on to figure out.</p><p>When requirements change, the risk of Unclear Expectations arises. If requested changes were communicated verbally or somewhere on Slack and were accompanied by a vivid discussion, it won’t be clear for the developers what to deliver. Even worse if there are multiple channels of communication in your organization: E-mails, multiple Slack channels, Jira tickets, Wiki documents.</p><p>It is imperative that you settle for a <strong>Single Source Of Truth</strong> and document everything in one place. Be it a ticket in your system or a Slack channel created explicitly for this issue. Keep all discussions formal and documented. This helps to track why decisions are made and what is the final verdict.</p><p>Document when things changed and why they changed. Date of change is very important. You can compare it with when was the last time software was released to see if your change is available. It is important information to reason about the problem with all stakeholders and developers. Equally important is the “why”. Not for blaming but to learn and improve the system. Like a black box on an airplane shows what went wrong before the crash, similarly a formal record of changes shows what could be improved if things go south.</p><p>As you see, communication is a challenge within a single team. But things change drastically if you depend on others. We will talk about this next.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-dependency-on-others">3. Dependency On Others<a href="#3-dependency-on-others" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. Dependency On Others" title="Direct link to 3. Dependency On Others">​</a></h2><p>You can test, understand and rely on everything you control. Everything else is a risk. The more dependencies in your software project, the bigger the risk that someone will bring troubles. Planning and communicating in a single, standalone team is very difficult. Every extra team in the equation multiplies the efforts.</p><p>Dependencies take various forms. It could be a decision from one of the stakeholders or managers, internal service provided by other teams (think authentication or some kind of platform) or even a library your developers use. If something is not maintained by you or your team, it's a dependency and it can go wrong.</p><p>There is no silver bullet for dependencies. Organizations are complex systems and we all are meant to operate together. And this is good! Dependencies allow us to throw away some of the responsibilities and focus on producing real value. But you must prepare for the failures of others.</p><p>Make a list of all your dependencies and answer following questions:</p><ul><li><p>Do we really need this?</p></li><li><p>What is an alternative and what it costs?</p></li><li><p>What will happen if it disappears?</p></li><li><p>What will happen if it changes unexpectedly?</p></li><li><p>What will happen if we need it to change?</p></li><li><p>Who is my contact person for this particular dependency?</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>In this article we listed 3 big risks in software development and briefly explained how to avoid them. Software is hard and expensive. Oftentimes it is worth asking for a second opinion to avoid costly mistakes. I would like to ask you to share this article with anyone who deals with software (maybe on LinkedIn) and I invite you to contact me using the button below and tell me about your business problems. It is free and I’m sure you will get massive value out of it.</p>]]></content>
